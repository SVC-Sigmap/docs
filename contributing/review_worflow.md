# Workflow Guide - Reviewing Programming Tasks

The review of tasks is dived up as follows:

**iOS App Team**:
- Jacob will review code from Jack
- Jack will review code from Jacob

**Create 3 Team**:
- Tony will review code from Matt
- Cam will review code from Tony
- Matt will review code from Cam

*Additional reviews can be performed at the request of the PR author.*

## Reviewing PRs / Tasks
 The following should be used to review tasks:
 
 ### Check Jira Frequently
 Each member should check the Jira at least a few times a day to see if there are any tasks in the review column done by the person they review.
 
 ### If there are tasks in review
 - Look for a PR on Github
 - Pull and Checkout the branch
 - Run the code from the branch and test the results.
  - Test iOS App in simulator
  - Test robot code on the robot or simulator

### Review the code
- Look over the code diffs in the commits for the PR.
- Make sure that the code guidelines are being followed.

### Merging
If the PR passes reviewer's tests and the code looks acceptable, Approve and Merge the PR.

### If the PR fails
Leave a comment for the PR author as a review. Be descriptive and use screenshots if applicable. You may also DM the author **in addition** to commenting on the PR. Repeat previous steps once appropriate action has been taken by the author.
